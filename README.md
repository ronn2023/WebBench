# WebBench

This is my work from my research at Brown University under Professor Theophilus Benson. For project details/abstract, view attached pdf. In summary, I worked to build a tool that would summarize a list of websites and output a shorter, representative sample. Our intent is to help developers test optimizations by giving them a means to test their changes on less websites, thus saving time and resources. In this project I used scikit learn to implement different clustering techniques such as Gaussian mixed modeling, K-means clustering, DBSCAN, and more. Then, I used sampling techniques to generate a final list of websites. This project allowed me to learn about clustering, sampling, and building a clean dataset to perform quantitative analysis of websites. In the process of building my dataset, I had to learn about networking and the impact of different page elements on load times.
